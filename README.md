# XPretrain

This repo includes some recent research works in **multi-modality learning**, especially with **pre-training** method from [MSM group](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/multimedia-search-and-mining/) of Microsoft Research. 

## Multi-modality Learning

### ***** Video & Language *****

#### Dataset

> [**HD-VILA-100M dataset**](https://github.com/microsoft/XPretrain/tree/main/hd-vila-100m): high-resolution and diversified video-language dataset

#### Pre-training model

> [**HD-VILA (CVPR 2022)**](https://github.com/microsoft/XPretrain/tree/main/hd-vila): high-resolution and diversified video-language pre-training model

> [**LF-VILA (NeurIPS 2022)**](https://github.com/microsoft/XPretrain/tree/main/LF-VILA): long-form video-language pre-training model

> [**CLIP-ViP (ICLR 2023)**](https://github.com/microsoft/XPretrain/tree/main/CLIP-ViP): adapting image-language pre-training to video-language pretraining model

### ***** Image & Language *****

#### Pre-training model

> [**Pixel-BERT**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.00849.pdf): end-to-end image and language pre-training model

> [**SOHO (CVPR 2021 oral)**](https://github.com/researchmm/soho): improved end-to-end image and language pre-training model with quantized visual tokens

> [**VisualParsing (NeurIPS 2021)**](https://github.com/microsoft/XPretrain/tree/main/visualparsing): Transformer-based end-to-end image and language pre-training model
